How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?

It was a little bit harder working with a pair on wireframing I found. It seems like more of a solitary activity than one you'd do with someone else for a site like this.

Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?

Yes, I think wireframing makes it a lot easier once you're actually writing the HTML out to know where you want to put things.

What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?

We decided that a good wireframe is really basic, without using colors or any detailed design. This makes it a lot easier to write out the HTML without getting tripped up in the details.

What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?

I didn't use any new semantic elements in this challenge.
