      <h2>Using Ruby Classes</h2>
      <h3>March 18, 2016</h3>
      <p>Classes in Ruby can be incredibly useful when trying to group together similar methods that all have similar functions or methods that need to share variables.</p>
<p>To show the benefits of classes, let's take a look at a quick example:</p>
<pre><code>
class Card
  def initialize(suit, number)
    @number = number.to_s
    @suit = suit
  end

  def to_s
    @number + " of "+  @suit
  end
end
</code></pre>
<p>Here we have a <code>Card</code> class that will create a card with a suit and number. It also overwrites the built in <code>to_s</code> method to display the card properly after it's been created. Let's see this code in action:</p>
<pre><code>
new_card = Card.new("Hearts","8")

puts new_card

=>8 of Hearts
</code></pre>
<p>Awesome. We created a new class, <code>Card</code>, that has two instance variables, <code>@number</code> and <code>suit</code>. Within our class, we have two instance methods, <code>initialize</code> which runs when we set a new instance of this class and <code>to_s</code> which returns our new card formatted properly. When we want to utilize the variables defined in <code>initialize</code> when we run <code>to_s</code> we can do so because they are instance variables and are available within the <code>Card</code> class.</p>
<p>What if we want to create a whole deck of cards? Let's create another class that will make a new deck of cards and then interact with them.</p>
<pre><code>
class Deck
  def initialize
    suits = ["Hearts", "Spades", "Diamonds", "Clubs"]
    numbers = ["A","2","3","4","5","6","7","8","9","10","J","Q","K"]

    @cards = Array.new

    suits.each do |suit|
      numbers.each do |number|
        @cards.push(Card.new(suit, number))
      end
    end
  end

  def shuffle_cards
    puts "Shuffling!"
    @cards.shuffle!
  end

  def show_first
    puts @cards[0]
  end

  def deal_cards(num_cards)
    @cards.shift(num_cards).each do |card|
      puts card
    end
  end

end
</code></pre>
<p>Fantastic! In this <code>Deck</code> class we start off the <code>initialize</code> method we start off with two local variables, <code>suits</code> and <code>numbers</code>. Since we don't need to refer to them outside of the <code>initialize</code> method we don't need to make them instance variables.</p>
<p>We do, however, need to make reference to the new deck of cards that is created when we make a new instance of <code>Deck</code>. We do that with the instance variable <code>@cards</code> that is used throughout the rest of the instance methods when we want to make reference to the cards in our deck.</p>
<p>Let's check out the <code>Deck</code> method in action:</p>
<pre><code>
deck = Deck.new
deck.show_first
=>A of Hearts
deck.shuffle_cards
=>Shuffling!
deck.show_first
=>8 of Clubs
deck.deal_cards(3)
=>8 of Clubs
=>K of Diamonds
=>5 of Hearts
</code></pre>
<p>Wonderful. Did you notice that our <code>Deck</code> class uses the <code>Card</code> class when initializing the deck? Now when we use the <code>puts</code> method on elements in our <code>@cards</code> array that was created with instances of the <code>Card</code> class it is able to use our redefined <code>to_s</code> method within the <code>Card</code> class.</p>
<p>I hope you found this brief introduction to Ruby Classes to be helpful!</p>

How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?

It was a little bit harder working with a pair on wireframing I found. It seems like more of a solitary activity than one you'd do with someone else for a site like this.

Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?

Yes, I think wireframing makes it a lot easier once you're actually writing the HTML out to know where you want to put things.

What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?

We decided that a good wireframe is really basic, without using colors or any detailed design. This makes it a lot easier to write out the HTML without getting tripped up in the details.

What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?

I didn't use any new semantic elements in this challenge.
