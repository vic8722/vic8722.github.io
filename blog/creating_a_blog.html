    <h3>Biography</h3>
    <p>The process of creating a blog has definitely been quite the learning experience for me. It reminds me of the late 90s when making a 'Xanga' page was the most popular thing to do. Like back then, this process is equally as frustrating for me now.</p>
    <p>I find myself underwhelmed with the whole process. As a more 'left-brained' type person, I am not very into asthetics. I find spending time trying to make the websites look good and display nicely to be somewhat tedious.</p>
    <p>Also, for whatever reason, the whole process does not come nearly as intuitively to me as say Ruby or JavaScript. I spent a good few hours today trying to figure out how to use Bootstrap and Jekyll, but ultimately got annoyed with the entire process and gave up.</p>
    <p>I'm sure later on I'll come back to it and spend some more time making this website look nice. But until then, I will focus my energy on the other aspects of web development that I've been enjoying more.</p>
