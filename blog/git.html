        Over the course of a child’s education, reports are often required as demonstrations of knowledge gained. In primary school, these reports would often start off small. Read a book and write a paragraph summarizing the characters and plot. An activity like this can be completed in a short amount of time by one person. This type of assignment isn’t very difficult to manage, in can be written in a short amount of time without much need to compare to previous versions of the report. However, throughout school learning and projects become larger and larger. Towards the end of high school, a history project could require several weeks of research and be a team assignment with many different sections, gathering input from several students. Keeping track of  each contributors changes made to the main document as well as any edits they may provide for their classmate’s portions can be much more difficult to track.

        Much like this, developers who work on complex programming projects often have several programmers working on the code in many different features. Additionally, as changes are made there is always a chance that a bug can be introduced that can cause problems that need to be addressed. In order to track the changes made to the code, git provides version control on the files being created and edited to help make revision easier. Git records the user, time, and what changes are made to the code so that if needed, one can go back to a previous version of the code to review what was done or to find the source of any bugs. It also allows you to revert to previous working versions of the code.

        GitHub is an online storage system that keeps track of the git version control changes made to one’s code. It allows multiple users to save and share their code in a convenient manner.

      <p>
        GitHub is a distributed version control system. For this method, each individual has their own copy of all files in the repository and history of changes on their local computer. Distributed version control being hosted on one’s local computer (as opposed to on a server) makes committing changes much quicker.

        The other method is a centralized version control system. The difference is instead of having several copies stored on individual computers, there is one central copy of the project stored on a server and each user updates their changes to the centralized copy. This can make updating changes take much longer than the distributed method. The only major advantage would be in rare cases where a project has an unusually large amount of large files or very long histories that take up a lot of space to store.
