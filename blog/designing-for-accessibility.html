      <h2>Designing for Accessibility</h2>
      <h3>March 6, 2016</h3>
      <p>When a web designer is set to the task of creating a website a few things usually come to mind. Designing the layout, making sure all the information needed is on the page, setting up all the links so they work, and making the color scheme beautiful are all important and can take up a lot of time. Until recently, designing websites so that they can be accessible by all users including those with physical impairments has not been a top priority. Fortunately most companies have started taking accessibility into account when designing their products.</p>
      <p>One of the main features being used to improve visually impaired users ability to navigate the web is screen readers. With the additional elements added in HTML5 using a screen reader is much easier to navigate to the appropriate sections of a website, however that assumes that the website was written well including lots of tags to identify the different sections appropriately. For example, the <code>&lt;main&gt;</code>tag can be used so the screen reader can know which part of the site contains the main content. Likewise, the <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code> tag can be used to quickly identify the navigation bar.</p>
      <p>Another way to improve accessibility, more likely to be used at larger companies, is to involve physically impaired persons for testing. Involving people with disabilities early in the design process will help to improve the design overall for both people with and without disabilities. Early implementation will also help to prevent rework, as waiting to implement accessibility early on can often require a site to need to be reworked once accessibility is needed later on.</p>
