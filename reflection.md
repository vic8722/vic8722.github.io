- What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?

 - I learned that padding is the space between the edge of the element and the next element, border is the physical line around the edge of the element, and margin is the space between the border and the content.

- What did you learn about CSS positioning?

 - I learned that it's much more difficult to get things arranged on a webpage than one might initially think. Positioning elements takes some care to get things spaced out well, and often when you adjust the browser window things will behave differently than you might expect.

- What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?

 - I think the easiest aspect was modifying the text (size, color, etc.) and the most difficult was positioning.

- What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?

 - I thought it was interesting to go to the blog site after updating the CSS mainly for the index page. Most of the element styling looked pretty good, but it was also somewhat of a suprise when there was some text I had that was left completely unformatted. I had an extra header in the blog site, which I needed to add CSS for in the blog.css page to make sure it shows up with formatting to match.
